Hello Teacher,

this is the note about the assignment that I submited. This is not a finished project
and there are many requirements that I fail to meet  because my understanding in the
interaction between frontend and backend and database is still limited and so as my 
skills in the languages and tools. Admittedly, I do this project by following one of 
the toturials in youtube about a similair concept but I face with a lot of errors that 
was to fix. I only finished about 60% of the project by deadline time. I hope you can
take a look at the codes and score it however you see fit.
** Finished part
- Home page: product from backend, promotion not from backend
- Detail page: I did every I suppose to do but I can't fetch the data from the backend so
  it will show error.
- Log In page: it works and the users are stored in database
- Register page: the same a detail page, it will show error
- Admin Panel: I have not finish anything except for html and css (in templete folder)
- I have coded most of the backend and frontend but I cannot connect them.

+ frontend: ReactJS 
+ backend: NodeJS
+ database: MogoDB Atlas

* Note: I dont have a group or partner so I do it alone.
